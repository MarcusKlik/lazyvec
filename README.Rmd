> This repository is home to the `lazyvec` package. `lazyvec` depends heavily on the (complete) ALTREP framework that
was rolled out with `R` 3.6.0. Therefore, you need at least this version of `R` to build or use the package.

## Overview

The [_lazyvec_ package][lazyvecRepo] for `R` provides an easy way to create custom `ALTREP` vectors without the need to write any `C/C++` code. The package provides the necessary ALTREP method overrides that are normally implemented in `C/C++` and allows the user to write their much simpler `R` equivalents.

In addition to providing the tools to generate custom ALTREP's, `lazyvec` provides a diagnostic framework to
observe the internal calls made to existing or custom ALTREP vectors.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fstpackage/lazyvec")
```

## Basic usage

To observe the internal behaviour of ALTREP ranges, the object can be wrapped:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(lazyvec)

x <- 1:10  # a range

# ranges are implemented as ALTREP for R versions > 3.5.0
is_altrep(x)

# wrap ALTREP vector
y <- alt_wrap(x, "x")
```

We can already see `R` making calls to the ALTREP vector. Subsequent operations will reveal more of
these internal calls to `x`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
# single element
y[2]

# vector length
length(y)

# sum
sum(y)
```

As can be seen, no elements are actually retrieved to calculate the sum, only the internal ALTREP
method for calculating the sum is called.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# print vector
min(y)
```
